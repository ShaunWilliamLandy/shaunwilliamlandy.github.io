          <h2>ITS Cyber Security Week</h2>
          <p>
            IT Services at the University of the West of England commissioned a team of four students 
            through enterprise studio Playwest to develop three games that cover cyber security concepts 
            while being a spin on classic arcade games. Four arcade cabinets were built to house the three 
            games and were shown on campus to staff and students during Cyber Security Week.

          <h2>Type Fighter</h2>
          <p>
            Type Fighter is an asymmetrical two player shoot 'em up typing game where one player moves and 
            shoots while the other player supports by typing in commands, created using C# in Unity. 
            This was created during a week long gamejam with the theme of 80's arcade and computer security. 
            A further two weeks were spent expanding and polishing the game, the final game having three 
            levels and a tutorial level. This was created by a team of four people 
            (three programmers and an artist) with C# in Unity, music was provided by Ryan Callard.
          </p>
          <p>Inspiration for the supporting abilities comes from computer terms that relate to computer security:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Update unlocks more abilities and upgrades the player</li>
            <li>Firewall and Spam Filter generate protective walls</li>
            <li>Antivirus and Scans temporarily upgrade the players projectiles (exploding and homing)</li>
            <li>Restore heals the player</li>
            <li>Authenticate activates a powerful laser weapon that sweeps through enemies</li>
            <li>Backup generates copies of the player and can revive the player if they get destroyed</li>
            <li>Encrypt locks the players health making them temporarily invincible</li>
            <li>Factory-Reset resets all current elements (updates, health, lives, destroys all enemies) of the game except for score</li>  
          </ul>
          <p>Inspiration for the enemies come from computer security risks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spam/Adware cause popups to appear</li>
            <li>Spyware follow the player when they close enough</li>
            <li>DoS appear in large amounts and rush the player</li>
            <li>Keylogger that only shoots when the supporting player types</li>
            <li>Trojans that multiply on death</li>
            <li>Corrupted files that have varying abilities</li>
            <li>Four different bosses that can only be defeated by guessing the bosses password</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Key features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Asymmetrical multiplayer</li>
            <li>Shoot 'em up with typing</li>

          <h2>Spamphibian</h2>
          <p>
            Spamphibian is an email management game which takes inspiration from the arcade classic, Frogger. 
            The player must navigate an office, avoiding co-workers and sorting emails all the while 
            trying to keep the boss happy. Emails must be sorted depending on whether they are spam or 
            from a legitimate source. Things to look for that may identify what category the email should 
            be sorted to are the sender address, the content and any suspicious links. There are five days to 
            survive with ramping difficulty as the workers move faster, email sorting requirement increases 
            and the boss becomes more easily agitated. Depending on player actions and performance there are 
            seven possible endings. Created in three weeks were spent expanding and polishing the game, the 
            final game having three levels and a tutorial level. This was created by a team of four 
            people (three programmers and an artist) with C# in Unity, music was provided by Ryan Callard.
